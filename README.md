### Explainer Apps for Network Analysis Concepts, Metrics, and Models

> Ever wondered how Kevin Bacon connects to everyone in Hollywood? Or how your social network knows that *friend of a friend* you should totally meet? Dive into the beautiful mathematics of networks! 🎯

> [!NOTE]
> 📚 This project was developed as part of **ENFO9073 "Social Network Analysis"** — a doctoral program course. Built using AI-assisted "vibe coding" — if you spot any bugs, that's just the AI vibing a little too hard! 🤖✨

## ✨ Interactive Apps

### 🔗 Link Prediction

| App | What You'll Learn |
|-----|------------------|
| **Adamic-Adar Index** | Predict missing links using shared neighbors — rare friends count more! |
| **Adamic-Adar Similarity** | Measure how similar two people are based on interests, location & more |

### 🌐 Small-World Networks

| App | What You'll Learn |
|-----|------------------|
| **Watts-Strogatz Model** | Watch networks transform with a little randomness — the "six degrees" magic! |
| **3D Kleinberg Navigation** | Navigate a 3D lattice using only local knowledge — greedy routing in action |

### 📊 Graph Metrics

| App | What You'll Learn |
|-----|------------------|
| **Average Path Length** | How many hops to reach anyone? Visualize shortest paths in real-time |
